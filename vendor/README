Directory Structure
-------------------

Vendor packages are organized into directories by package. The full and minified
source are included.

Package Versions
----------------

The unminified source includes the version of the package
in the header comment. By ensuring the version is always in the header comment
of the unminified source, the files may be named after the package without
any version in the filename. This eliminates the need to modify filepaths when
dependencies are upgraded.

Licenses
--------

The LICENSE file is always included with vendor packages, and included in
production builds where required.
